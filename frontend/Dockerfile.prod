# Frontend Production Dockerfile
# Multi-stage build: build static files then serve via nginx

# Stage 1: Build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (for better caching)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build for production

# Stage 2: Production image (output only)
# Just outputs the built files - nginx will serve them
FROM alpine:latest AS production

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built files from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# This image is just for extracting build artifacts
CMD ["echo", "Build complete. Use dist/ folder."]
